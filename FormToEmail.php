FormToEmail DESCRIPTION

FormToEmail is a contact-form processing script written in PHP. It allows you to place a form on your website which your visitors can fill out and send to you.  The contents of the form are sent to the email address (or addresses) which you specify below.  The form allows your visitors to enter their name, email address and comments.  The script will not allow a blank form to be sent.

Your visitors (and nasty spambots!) cannot see your email address.  The script cannot be hijacked by spammers.

When the form is sent, your visitor will get a confirmation of this on the screen, and will be given a link to continue to your homepage, or other page if you specify it.

Should you need the facility, you can add additional fields to your form, which this script will also process without making any additional changes to the script.  You can also use it to process other forms.  The script will handle the "POST" or "GET" methods.  It will also handle multiple select inputs and multiple check box inputs.  If using these, you must name the field as an array using square brackets, like so: <select name="fruit[]" multiple>.  The same goes for check boxes if you are using more than one with the same name, like so: <input type="checkbox" name="fruit[]" value="apple">Apple<input type="checkbox" name="fruit[]" value="orange">Orange<input type="checkbox" name="fruit[]" value="banana">Banana

** PLEASE NOTE **  If you are using the script to process your own forms (or older FormToEmail forms) you must ensure that the email field is named correctly in your form, like this for example: <input type="text" name="email">.  Note the lower case "email".  If you don't do this, the visitor's email address will not be available to the script and the script won't be able to check the validity of the email, amongst other things.  If you are using the form code below, you don't need to check for this.

This is a PHP script.  In order for it to run, you must have PHP (version 4.1.0 or later) on your webhosting account, and have the PHP mail() function enabled and working.  If you are not sure about this, please ask your webhost about it.

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

Step 1: Put the form on your webpage
Step 2: Enter your email address and (optional) continue link below
Step 3: Upload the files to your webspace

Step 1:

To put the form on your webpage, copy the code below as it is, and paste it into your webpage:

<form action="FormToEmail.php" method="post">
<table border="0" style="background:#ececec" cellspacing="5">
<tr align="left"><td>Name</td><td><input type="text" size="30" name="name"></td></tr>
<tr align="left"><td>Email address</td><td><input type="text" size="30" name="email"></td></tr>
<tr align="left"><td valign="top">Comments</td><td><textarea name="comments" rows="6" cols="30"></textarea></td></tr>
<tr align="left"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><input type="submit" value="Send"><font face="arial" size="1">&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://FormToEmail.com">PHP Form</a> by FormToEmail.com</font></td></tr>
</table>
</form>

Step 2:

Enter your email address.

Enter the email address below to send the contents of the form to.  You can enter more than one email address separated by commas, like so: $my_email = "info@example.com"; or $my_email = "bob@example.com,sales@example.co.uk,jane@example.com";

*/

$my_email = "theqk171@gmail.com";

/*

Optional.  Enter a From: email address.  Only do this if you know you need to.  By default, the email you get from the script will show the visitor's email address as the From: address.  In most cases this is desirable.  On the majority of setups this won't be a problem but a minority of hosts insist that the From: address must be from a domain on the server.  For example, if you have the domain example.com hosted on your server, then the From: email address must be something@example.com (See your host for confirmation).  This means that your visitor's email address will not show as the From: address, and if you hit "Reply" to the email from the script, you will not be replying to your visitor.  You can get around this by hard-coding a From: address into the script using the configuration option below.  Enabling this option means that the visitor's email address goes into a Reply-To: header, which means you can hit "Reply" to respond to the visitor in the conventional way.  (You can also use this option if your form does not collect an email address from the visitor, such as a survey, for example, and a From: address is required by your email server.)  The default value is: $from_email = "";  Enter the desired email address between the quotes, like this example: $from_email = "contact@example.com";  In these cases, it is not uncommon for the From: ($from_email) address to be the same as the To: ($my_email) address, which on the face of it appears somewhat goofy, but that's what some hosts require.

*/

$from_email = "";

/*

Optional.  Enter the continue link to offer the user after the form is sent.  If you do not change this, your visitor will be given a continue link to your homepage.

If you do change it, remove the "/" symbol below and replace with the name of the page to link to, eg: "mypage.htm" or "http://www.elsewhere.com/page.htm"

*/

$continue = "/mrc";

/*

Step 3:

Save this file (FormToEmail.php) and upload it together with your webpage containing the form to your webspace.  IMPORTANT - The file name is case sensitive!  You must save it exactly as it is named above!

THAT'S IT, FINISHED!

You do not need to make any changes below this line.
